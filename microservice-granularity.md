## Microservice Granularity

Determining the right sizing or granularity for microservices is crucial for building an effective and maintainable system. 
Domain Driven Design helps you to decompose the domain into multiple subdomains or business capabilities (bounded contexts) that can be independently manaegable. Identifying the indepent bounded contexts plays crucial role in decomposing subdomains into Microservices.
Overly fine-grained services can result in high inter-service communication, causing tight coupling and performance issues. Conversely, excessively coarse-grained services may encounter similar challenges to those of a monolithic architecture.


Here are some key considerations and guidelines to help you achieve the right granularity:
